It is said that one night in 1064 YW, an errant elf well-learned in the mystic arts chanced upon the small fishing village of Krysvelen while it was under threat by hostile orcs. The unmatched prowess of the archers manning the village’s defense caught the elf by surprise, for he had never seen humans able to surpass elvenkind’s skill with the bow and arrow. He was so impressed, after the end of the battle he used his magic to give the Krysvelenians a parting gift: an enchanted bow that imbues any arrows shot with a powerful ice magic capable of slowing down targets to a crawl.

Of course the veracity of the story has been disputed too many times to count, especially since nobody ever found any solid proof of the bow’s existence, and most accounts claim that the elf was over a thousand years old — imagine the insanity! But how on earth did the bow find its way from the Glamdrol mountain range to this region? No matter, we should just get on with it and give it to one of our most skilled archers.")
